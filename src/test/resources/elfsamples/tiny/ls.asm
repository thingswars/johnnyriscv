;; Usage: ls [-abdilsBCFNR1] [--] [FILE]...
;; -C  columnar output; default if stdout is a tty
;; -1  one file per output line; default if stdout is not a tty
;; -l  "long" output
;; -F  show file type suffixes
;; -i  show inode numbers
;; -s  show size of files in 1K-blocks
;; -d  don't expand directories
;; -a  show all (hidden) files
;; -B  don't show files ending in ~ (backups)
;; -N  don't replace non-graphic characters with a question mark
;; -b  show non-graphic characters as octal escape sequences
;; -R  recursively list contents of subdirectories
;;
;; Differences from GNU ls:
;; * Columnar output isn't very intelligent. (Real columns would
;;   require loading the entire directory contents before displaying.)
;; * There are no sorting options. (Ditto previous obstacle.)
;; * There is no option to print uid/gid by name. (This would require
;;   reading and parsing the appropriate /etc files.)
;; * Showing the file's modification age is less useful than the
;;   modification time. (This would require reading /etc/localtime to
;;   get the proper offset from UTC.)
