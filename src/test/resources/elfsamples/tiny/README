This directory contains the elf files and accompanying assembly sources from:

"A Whirlwind Tutorial on Creating Really Teensy ELF Executables for Linux"

http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html

These are some fun and interesting examples of elf files. Well worth a
look in their own right, but they are included here to help us
test the boundaries of the elf parser.

They are covered under GPLv2+. As we are just parsing the binaries as
program input at test time, this is assumed in good faith to be
[mere aggregation](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation).
